# Incremental Delta-Sigma ADC Matlab Code
Generic incremental delta-sigma modulator models (1st order, 2nd order, 3rd order) to simulate different kinds of digital filters.

The file contains different code as per the name of the file to simulate incremental delta-sigma ADCs. Moreover, the performance of different filters (CoI filter, CIC filter, optimal filter) can be simulated easily with the attached matlab code. More information about the decoders mentioned in the code can be found in:
